# Handwritten-digit-recognition
Handwritten Digit Recognition (HWDR) using TensorFlow and Keras. This project features a CNN-based model trained on the MNIST dataset for accurate digit classification. It includes a complete training pipeline, performance evaluation, and an interactive UI for practical exploration of machine learning and computer vision.
This project is about recognizing handwritten digits, like those you write on paper, using a computer. It uses powerful tools like TensorFlow and Keras to teach the computer how to identify these numbers.
What This Project Does
- Uses the MNIST dataset: A popular collection of handwritten digits (0-9).
- Builds a model: A type of program (CNN - Convolutional Neural Network) that learns to recognize patterns in the digits.
- Trains and Tests: The model is trained on thousands of digit images and then tested to see how well it performs.
- Interactive Tool: You can draw a digit, and the program will try to guess what it is!

Why This Project is Useful
Handwritten Digit Recognition is a basic example of how computers learn and understand images. Itâ€™s a stepping stone to bigger applications like facial recognition, license plate detection, and more!
How to Use
